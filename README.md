### Example 1: A Basic Form with Accordion, Group, and Separator Fields
- You see more on one screen.
- The Accordion is more beautiful and doesn't look like the separator field.
- Group fields are based on the accordion, with a clear distinction between fields outside and inside the group. All fields are wrapped with a border line.
